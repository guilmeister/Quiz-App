• After entering the Quiz Details, it will take you to the Quiz Creator Screen where you can set a question, set 4 choices for that question and set the value of that choice to either true or false by turning the switches. The switch that is on will be the correct value for that question and the rest of the choices must be turned off or there will be an error.

• After submitting the newly created quiz, it will take you back to the Admin Main Menu and you can log out by clicking anywhere and a side menu will show up on the left side.
